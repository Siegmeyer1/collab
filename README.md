# Collab: a Go-backend for Yjs
This project is my Master's work at Moscow Aviation Institute. Basically, it is distributed scalable 
backend for Yjs framework, written in Go. On Yjs-side, you use it as regular `WebsocketProvider`, but 
you can arrange multiple workers to make your system more fault-tolerant.
